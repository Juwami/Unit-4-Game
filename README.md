Game created using HTML, CSS, and JQuery

## How the Game Works
As the page is loaded, a 'Needed Score: ' is randomly generated. There are five crystals shown that each have a randomly generated value between one and twelve. The user memorize each value as the crystals are clicked to ultimately equal the 'Needed Score: '. Reaching a score higher than the Needed Score will result in a loss while achieving the exact number will result in a win.
